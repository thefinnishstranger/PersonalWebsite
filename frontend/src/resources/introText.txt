Hi, my name is Nikolas, and I'm a committed Computer Science student-athlete at the University of Texas at Tyler. I am currently pursuing my B.S. degree, after which I am planning on pursuing an M.S. degree in Computer Science. Balancing my academic life with being an NCAA athlete has taught me the importance of discipline, teamwork, and effective communication, skills I believe are critical in the industry that I'm pursuing. With a solid foundation in mathematics and ongoing studies in computer science, I am passionate about utilizing my technical skills. Over the years, I have gathered proficiency in several programming languages and development tools to create different projects from scratch. Currently, I am specializing in full-stack engineering, focusing on technologies such as React, TypeScript, Express, MongoDB, Node.js, and Docker. I am excited to connect with professionals and opportunities that align with my commitment to growth, learning, and collaboration in the field of technology.
